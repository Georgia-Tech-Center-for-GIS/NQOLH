	<div id="tabs-6" style="font:16px 'Century Gothic', Sans-Serif">
<div id="flip-1" style="margin-top: 5px;"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">Why are NPUs used as the spatial unit for this analysis? </a></div>
<div id="panel-1">Atlanta has a strong neighborhood-based administrative and political structure in which the neighborhoods are delineated by Neighborhood Planning Units or NPUs. These neighborhoods have representation in the City Council and form the smallest spatial unit for planning purposes. Also, the City of Atlanta&#8217s 2011 Comprehensive Development Plan Update survey was an important source of perceptual information that was available at the level of NPUs. This information was critical for weighting our objective indicators. Without such a survey an aggregate index of Quality of Life would not be appropriate.</div>
<div id="flip-2"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">What is the value added of this tool?</a></div>
<div id="panel-2">This tool provides a one-stop portal for obtaining data on specific quality of life attributes for each NPU and offers a means for comparative assessment across the NPUs. The information available can show how an NPU is performing compared to other NPUs on specific indicators and on aggregate indices of QoL and community health. In future, the tool will also provide information on trends in such indicators and aggregate indices.</div>
<div id="flip-3"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">Why do you report QoL and Health rankings s/comparisons?</a></div>
<div id="panel-3">We embarked on this project on the premise that QoL and community health would be closely related. That is, neighborhoods and places that offer high quality of life would also induce people to engage in behavior that improves their health status. For example, we expect lively walkable places that offer good access to green spaces and to recreational opportunities are likely to make people more active; thereby reducing obesity related diseases. Indeed, our indicators of QoL and Health show a strong correlation between the two.</div>
<div id="flip-4"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">Why rank NPUs health?</a></div>
<div id="panel-4">Community health has long been regarded as a key indicator of quality of life (e.g. statistics on child mortality, longevity, and incidence of communicable diseases). While such measures have been routinely used at the national and regional levels, few examples of health indicators at the neighborhood level exist. Our data shows that the built environment impacts both QoL and community health at the neighborhood level. Therefore, through this tool and our analysis, we suggest that investments in a high quality built environment would ultimately improve social well-being and reduce both downstream medical expenses and productivity losses due to ill health.</div>
<div id="flip-5"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">Are these weighted, if so how?</a></div>
<div id="panel-5">The individual indicators are derived from data that are mostly available through public sources. However, the aggregated index of QoL includes a weighting scheme based on the perceptions of the residents surveyed during the Comprehensive Development Plan Update process (CDP). The survey asked residents to offer comments on the important attributes of their community and highlight the attributes they find most attractive as well as those they find most deficient. We evaluated these responses to derive a ranking of such attributes and weighted them according to how many times they were mentioned by survey respondents. These weights were used in the corresponding objective data reflecting the attributes commented on to estimate the aggregated QoL index.  The health index weighted all four attributes included &#8211 mortality, morbidity, walkability, and nutrition &#8211 equally. More specific information about the weighting scheme can be found under each index in the Data and Methods section. </div>
<div id="flip-6"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">How do you aggregate the data across various spatial boundaries?</a></div>
<div id="panel-6">The data used in this analysis are sourced from state or national agencies that use spatial units applicable to most areas in the U.S. (such as the various census geographies and zip codes). Given that NPUs are specific to Atlanta, the data for this level of geography had to be estimated from smaller census geographies. NPUs generally include several census tracts; hence the data at the census tract level had to be aggregated up. While tracts that are completely within NPUs are easy to include in the total, those that are straddling the NPU boundaries needed special attention. In such cases where a census tract overlapped two or more NPUs, we assumed constant density of that attribute and apportioned the attribute according to the relative area of tract within a particular NPU.</div>
<div id="flip-7"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">What is the source of the NPU level health data?</a></div>
<div id="panel-7">NPU level hospital discharge The health indicators data on mortality and morbidity were were derived provided through a data request by the from Georgia Department of Public Health, Office of Health Indicators for Planning (OHIP). hospital discharge data that were provided at the level of census tracts to protect privacy. This data were aggregated to the NPU level using the technique discussed above.</div>
<div id="flip-8"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">How were the accessibility indicators calculated? </a></div>
<div id="panel-8">Several accessibility indicators were calculated in this study and the procedures for each varied slightly. Access to neighborhood retail was calculated by first determining the location of these retail centers as three or more retail destinations clustered within 1/10 mile. centers and then estimating tThe he percentage of population was then estimated that could access these centers within a walkable distance of 1/2 mile (a distance that is commonly reported in the literature as providing the optimum distance for walkability). Similarly, park access was also estimated by calculating the percentage of population within a Euclidean distance of 1/2 mile. In contrast, access to healthy food destinations was obtained by finding the percentage of households that did not own a car and lived 0.9 miles from a grocery store, supermarket, or other stores selling fresh produce. The threshold, 0.9 miles, was based on the average (straight-line) distance from households to food retail outlets in Atlanta.</div>
<div id="flip-9"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">What are socioeconomic conditions?</a></div>
<div id="panel-9">There is ample evidence to suggest that an individual&#8217s health outcomes and her quality of life are closely related to social status, which has a bearing on the socioeconomic status of the place where such individuals reside. We also know that households from similar social status usually collocate in the same neighborhoods. Therefore, to examine the specific role of the built environment in influencing health and quality of life, we need to control for socioeconomic status of the neighborhood. In this study we control for socioeconomic characteristics of a population by constructing a Socioeconomic Conditions Index that evaluates social and economic neighborhood level conditions with four indicators -- unemployment, education, poverty, and income. The indicators were combined (unweighted) with standardized scores and the resulting values were sorted by standard deviation. High SEC status represents values that are equal to or greater than a 0.5 standard deviation; Medium SEC includes the middle range of NPUs that fall within -0.5 and 0.5 standard deviations; and Low SEC comprises those that fall below -0.5 standard deviations. </div>
<div id="flip-10"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">Why does the health index correspond to obesity related diseases?</a></div>
<div id="panel-10">Obesity is termed the disease of this century and includes cardiovascular 
disease, cancer and diabetes in its list of comorbidities. Population health is 
increasingly recognized to be influenced by the social determinants of health 
– where you were born, the type of job you have, and where you were raised. 
Today the diseases that dominate the list of concern include chronic and 
noncommunicable rather than acute and infectious ones. Population level
strategies that are based on an ecological model offer promise of a 
sustainable solution because they make healthy choices the easy and thus 
default choice. Cumulatively, these lead to improved health outcomes. 
Specifically with obesity, remediating nutrition and physical activity behaviors
that arise from the design of the built environment have proven results.</div>
<div id="flip-11"><a style="color:#FFFFFF">How do you calculate the accidents indicator?</a></div>
<div id="panel-11">The Traffic injuries/fatalities measure is calculated as the number of persons 
injured or killed in vehicle-related accidents in an NPU compared to the 
residential population of an NPU. This measure omits accidents that occurred 
on expressways (Interstates 75, 85, 20, and GA 400), given that they service 
a regional population rather than specifically the neighborhood population, 
and are not tied in to the street grid so therefore do not pose a public safety 
risk to community residents.</div>
